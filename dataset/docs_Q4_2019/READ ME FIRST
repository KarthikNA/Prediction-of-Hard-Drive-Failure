These SQL scripts allow you to calculate the annual failure rate
for Q4 2019 for disk drives from the published CSV files.

A new SMART Stat was aded in Q4, consisting of 2 (two) fields new columns (fields) of data:

smart_18_normalized
smart_18_raw

facing after SMART_17_raw

First change your starting directory to the location of the sql files and the 2019 directory/folder.

Then use these commands to reproduce the results:

    $ sqlite3 drive_stats.db
    sqlite> .read create_Q4_2019.sql
    sqlite> .read import_Q4_2019.sql
    sqlite> .read stats_Q4_2019.sql
    sqlite> .mode columns
    sqlite> select * from failure_rates order by model;
